_ABOUT_
CPANPLUS::Shell::Wx (hereafter known as wxCPAN) is a GUI shell for CPANPLUS.
It has many of the same features as http://search.cpan.org and http://kobesearch.cpan.org/
To invoke wxCPAN, call `perl -MCPANPLUS -eshell(Wx)` from the command-line.
The program includes full online help under the Help menu.

_DEPENDENCIES_
This module requires these other modules and libraries:

    CPANPLUS
    Cwd
    IPC::Cmd
    Data::Dumper
    Wx
    Module::Load
    Params::Check
    Module::Load::Conditional
    Locale::Maketext::Simple
    File::Spec
    File::HomeDir
    Class::Struct

_INSTALLATION_
If you downloaded wxCPAN as a compressed archive,
you can install this module by uncompressing the archive
and typing the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

_GETTING HELP_
You can access the full online help via the About->Help menu item. 

_BUGS_
wxCPAN is alpha software, and relies on several other pieces of code from 
other developers, so bugs are to be expected. (wxCPAN itself contains
almost 5,000 lines of code, excluding resources and documentation!)
If you find a bug, please submit it using the issue tracker
at http://code.google.com/p/wxcpan/issues/list or by emailing
me via skamansam@gmail.com.

_FOR DEVELOPERS_
I wrote this tool as part of the Google Summer of Code 2008 program.
It is intended to be maintained after the program by myself or 
others who wish to contribute. If you want to see wxCPAN flourish as
a great tool for Perl developers and users, please consider contributing
time and code to the development of wxCPAN, as I will be a student 
until 2011, and do not have much time for this project. I will be devoting
as much as I can until it becomes obsolete. (Which may never happen!) I
also plan on making it compatible with future versions of Perl and
CPANPLUS. 

Every aspect of wxCPAN was created using free, cross-platform, open-source 
tools. I wanted this project to be maintained by anyone who wishes to
contribute, so I tried to use tools that were available to everyone.
I encourage future developers to do the same.

All of the code for wxCPAN was written using the excellent Eclipse
platform IDE (http://www.eclipse.org) with the EPIC (Eclipse Perl Integration)
plugin (http://e-p-i-c.sourceforge.net). 

The startup screen was built with the GIMP (http://gimp.org/). 
(see the wxCPAN about box to find out where I got the images.)

I used the wxWidgets cross-platform widget library for the GUI, and 
designed it using wxGlade (http://wxglade.sourceforge.net/). 

If you download the source via svn from http://wxcpan.googlecode.com, 
there should be some Eclipse-related files, so just import the existing
project into your workspace. To ease setup, you should 
download the svn repository to /mnt/development/wxCPANPLUS. 
This is the path I use. If you do not, be sure to change the wxGlade 
project paths so you can save to appropriate directories. 

Happy Coding!
