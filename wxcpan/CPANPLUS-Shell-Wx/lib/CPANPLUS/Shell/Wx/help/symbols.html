<h1>wxCPAN Symbols</h1>
<p>Some of the items in wxCPAN have status icons associated with them.
These icons are obtained via system calls to the appropriate libraries which retrieve
the related Stock Icons. They are as follows:</p>

<h3>Installed and Up To Date</h3>
<p>This is the wxART_TICK_MARK icon. On GTK platforms, it is a checkmark.</p>

<h3>Not current</h3>
<p>This is the wxART_ADD_BOOKMARK icon. On GTK platforms, it is a checkmark.
This icon means the current module is installed, but there is a newer
version available on CPAN.</p>

<h3>Remove</h3>
<p>This is the wxART_DEL_BOOKMARK icon. On GTK platforms, it is a red negative sign.
It means the current module has been removed, or is selected for removal.</p>

<h3>Not installed</h3>
<p>This is the wxART_NEW_DIR icon. It is the icon used in many applications,
on buttons for creating new folders. It means the module is not installed.</p>

<h3>Unknown</h3>
<p>This is the wxART_QUESTION icon. It is a question mark. It means the
module is unknown or information cannot be found. This icon appears beside
Author names, as the Author names are not the same as module names.</p>
